#### Analog Multiplexer

The image-rejection analog multiplexer extends signal bandwidth by three times through a combination of digital signal processing and analog multiplication. ([K. Kawahara et al.,	IEEE Trans. Microw. Theory Tech., vol. 71, no. 1, pp. 22‚Äì34, Jan. 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2022.3190480))

#### Active Balun

The active balun converts single-ended signals to differential signals. A small chip area and low imbalance characteristics over a wide bandwidth were demonstrated. ([K. Kawahara et al., IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. I: Regul. Pap., vol. 70, no. 6, pp. 2317‚Äì2330, Jun. 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2023.3257089))

#### Distributed Amplifier

The distributed amplifier operates over a wide bandwidth ranging from DC to tens of gigahertz. The use of coupling inductors halves the area of differential distributed amplifiers. ([K. Kawahara et al., IEICE Trans. Electron., vol. E106.C, no. 11, pp. 669‚Äì676, Nov. 2023.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1587/transele.2023MMP0006))

#### Temperature Sensor

The trimless temperature sensor is based on an open source design rule and is freely reusable. ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/keikawa/temperature-sensor-OpenRule1um).)

#### Operational Amplifiers

<img src="https://github.com/keikawa/keikawa/assets/37934321/bac48c37-9dc6-4ac8-a65d-e2768d07fd89" alt="CMOS Operational Amplifier" width="220">

The class-AB CMOS operational amplifier consumes only 7.7 ¬µA and has a slew rate of 1 V/¬µs for a 1-nF load. (Slides for [2021](https://www.ec.ict.e.titech.ac.jp/opamp/2021/contest-all-2021.pdf) and [2020](https://www.ec.ict.e.titech.ac.jp/opamp/2020/contest-all-2020.pdf).)
