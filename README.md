The image-rejection analog multiplexer increases signal bandwidth threefold by combining digital signal processing with analog multiplication. ([📑IEEE T-MTT](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2022.3190480)) ([📑IEEE RWS](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/RWS53089.2022.9719979))

#### Active Balun

The active balun converts single-ended signals to differential signals while maintaining a compact design and minimal imbalance. ([📑IEEE TCAS-I](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2023.3257089)) ([📑IEEE MWSCAS](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS47672.2021.9531759))

#### Distributed Amplifier

Coupled inductors reduce the area of the differential distributed amplifier by half and enable the amplification of differential signals at frequencies up to several tens of GHz. ([📑IEICE TREL](http://dx.doi.org/10.1587/transele.2023MMP0006)) ([📑IEEE ISCAS](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401302))

#### Temperature Sensor

The trimless temperature sensor is based on an open-source design rule and is freely reusable. ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/keikawa/temperature-sensor-OpenRule1um))

#### Operational Amplifiers

The class-AB CMOS operational amplifier consumes only 7.7 µA and has a slew rate of 1 V/µs with a 1-nF load. (Slides for [2021](https://www.ec.ict.e.titech.ac.jp/opamp/2021/contest-all-2021.pdf) and [2020](https://www.ec.ict.e.titech.ac.jp/opamp/2020/contest-all-2020.pdf))
