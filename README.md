The image-rejection analog multiplexer extends signal bandwidth by three times through a combination of digital signal processing and analog multiplication. ([K. Kawahara et al.,	IEEE Trans. Microw. Theory Tech., vol. 71, no. 1, pp. 22‚Äì34, Jan. 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2022.3190480))

#### Active Balun

Active balun converts single-ended signals to differential signals. A small chip area and low imbalance characteristics over a wide bandwidth were demonstrated. ([K. Kawahara et al., IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. I: Regul. Pap., vol. 70, no. 6, pp. 2317‚Äì2330, Jun. 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2023.3257089))

#### Differential Distributed Amplifier

Distributed amplifiers operate over a wide bandwidth ranging from DC to tens of gigahertz. The use of coupling inductors halves the area of differential distributed amplifiers. ([K. Kawahara et al., IEICE Trans. Electron., Article ID 2023MMP0006, Advance online publication, Apr. 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1587/transele.2023MMP0006))
